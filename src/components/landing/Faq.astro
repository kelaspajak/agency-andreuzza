          If I have a blog, do you count each post as a separate page?

        <p class="mt-4">
          The way we structure and charge for your blog pages can vary depending
          on your specific needs. Generally, individual blog posts can be
          counted as separate pages, but this can be discussed and tailored to
          your preferences during our project discussions. We aim to be flexible
          and accommodating to meet your requirements.
